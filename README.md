# PyMessenger
Hello! I am starter developer, and i wanted to make my own messenger, it could look ugly and bad, since that's my first ever project, so you can freely judge it.

Why did i decided to make this ? Well, i just wanted to make your chatting more private, since data only stores on your pc.

This version has access to memory stored public & private keys, so when you close and remove your messenger, database wouldn't be able to be decrypted.
